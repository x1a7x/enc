Here is a starter app for anyone interested in the otp method. I am not going to work on this much, as i have other interests. Not for production. My "XOR" app is far superior to this app. see readme.html in a browser for details how to use this app. If you use this app just feed it to chatgpt or other Ai and ask it about the many vulnerabilities in standard xor encryption. You should use a nonce/iv/salt in this, because each cyphertext should be different, even with the same key and file. Otherwise, it is very vulneralble- except if you adhere to all the true OTP procedures- in which case it might be unbreakable in theory. But i reccomend my xor app over this one, for sure.
